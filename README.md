# TableauServer-RESTAPI-CSharpWrapper
(Eventually will be a) C# Wrapper for the Tableau Server REST API.

I just need to grab the xsd and generate the REST XD of the classes.

The example script, GetADGroupandUserInfo, was actually the reason I started this. Therefore, I have only created classes corresponding to the endpoints I needed.

Long Term it would be nice to create a collection of scripts for common tasks with the Tableau Server REST API

Other Future Ideas:
-Possibly convert to asyncronous and HttpClient
-Add More Unit Tests
